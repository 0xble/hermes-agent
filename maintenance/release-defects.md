# Upstream release defects

Load this unit when changing gateway status for parked profiles or Bot Desktop
teardown during profile delete and rename.

These are narrow fixes for defects that shipped in upstream `v2026.9.24` and
were still present on upstream `main` when the fork synced. Offer each upstream
and drop it once upstream carries an equivalent fix.

## Parked status hides a live gateway

- Fork patch identity: `parked-status-live-gateway`.
- `hermes gateway status` returned "parked" before inspecting processes. A
  gateway started with `--force` bypasses parking and leaves the marker, so it
  was hidden, including from `--deep` and `--full`. Status now reports the
  parked marker and still shows a running gateway.
- Guard: `tests/hermes_cli/test_gateway_multiplex_lifecycle.py`
  (`test_parked_status_still_reports_a_forced_gateway`).

## Stale Bot Desktop lease survives a rename

- Fork patch identity: `rename-stale-lease`.
- Profile teardown released the human Bot Desktop lease only when
  `runtime.stop()` signalled a live screen. An already-dead screen returns
  False, so a rename moved the stale human lease into the new profile, where it
  fenced the agent out. The lease is now released whenever one exists after the
  screen is stopped.
- Guard: `tests/hermes_cli/test_profiles.py`
  (`test_profile_rename_clears_a_stale_human_lease_when_the_screen_was_already_stopped`).
